# Local voice input

Local voice input is available in the Flux desktop app on macOS, Windows x64, and Linux. It is
not available in the browser or mobile apps yet.

Select the microphone button beside Send to begin recording. Select the stop button to transcribe,
or press Escape to discard the recording. Flux inserts the result at the current composer cursor
and never sends it automatically.

The first recording asks before downloading Moonshine Streaming Tiny, a 48 MiB English speech
model. Flux verifies the model before using it. Speech processing runs on the local computer, and
microphone audio is kept in memory only for the current recording.

To remove the downloaded model, open Settings, then General, and select Remove model under Local
voice input.

On macOS, grant microphone access to Flux when prompted. If access was previously denied, enable it
under System Settings, Privacy & Security, Microphone.

Windows arm64 is not supported because the transcription runtime does not currently publish a
compatible native package.
