# Flux

Flux is an "agent harness control surface". It enables control of the agents on your machine with mobile, web, and Electron-based desktop apps.

Works with your subscriptions on Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Grok Build, and OpenCode. If they're set up on your computer, Flux can control them.

## "Wait, what are you selling me?"

Nothing. We built Flux because we wanted the best possible development experience with agents. We were inspired by existing solutions like the Codex desktop app, Conductor, Claude Desktop and Cursor Glass, but none met our bar.

We wanted something performant, remote-ready, and truly open. If we ever go the wrong direction, we want you to have everything you need to fork and build the editor that you want.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> Flux currently supports Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok Build and OpenCode. Install and authenticate at least one provider before use:
>
> - Codex: install [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) and run `codex login`
> - Claude: install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and run `claude auth login`
> - Cursor: install [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli) and run `agent login`
> - Grok Build: install [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai/cli) and run `grok login`
> - OpenCode: install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and run `opencode auth login`

### Try it out (install-free)

The easiest way to test Flux is to run the server from the repository in your terminal (requires Node.js 22.16+, 23.11+, or 24.10+):

```bash
vp run dev:web
```

This will launch Flux's backend on your machine as well as the local web app to control your agents.

### Desktop app

Install the latest version of the desktop app from [Flux GitHub Releases](https://github.com/stormey2010/Flux/releases).

## Some notes

We are very very early in this project. Expect bugs.

We are (mostly) not accepting contributions yet. Small fixes may be considered. Big features will not be.
